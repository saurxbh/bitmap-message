# bitmap-message
Program to display the user's message in the form of bitmap

This program uses a multiline string as a bitmap, a 2D image with only two possible colors for each pixel, to determine how it should display a message from the user. In this bitmap, space characters represent an empty space, and all other characters are replaced by characters in the userâ€™s message.
